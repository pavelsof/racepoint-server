Racepoint
================

Racepoint is a web application to be used by urban race organisers for: 
* Logging of arrival and departure times of teams at control points.
* Registration of teams.
* Providing real-time information about team's progress through the race.

The web application was (and is being) developed for the purposes of [Shemetna Varna](http://shemetna-varna.org) â€“ an urban race organised in Varna on an annual basis. Racepoint is an open source project and contributions are welcome.

Racepoint consists of a Django server and an [AngularJS client](http://github.com/pavelsof/racepoint-client). This repository contains the former.
